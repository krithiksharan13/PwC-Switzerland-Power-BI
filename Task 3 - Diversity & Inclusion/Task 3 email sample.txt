Respected Partner,

After the analysis of the data provided, I have come to the following conclusions to help reduce the overall churn rate:

1. Target Senior Citizen Segment
Offer personalized assistance and discounts to senior citizens to increase retention.

2. Engage Single Customers:
Create exclusive loyalty programs for singles to strengthen their connection with the service.

3. Incentivize Longer Contracts:
Provide additional benefits or cost savings for customers who opt for longer than 1-year contracts.

4. Enhance Fiber Optic Internet Experience:
Invest in improving fiber optic infrastructure and provide faster, more reliable internet service.

5. Proactive Customer Support for Admin Tickets:
Prioritize resolving admin tickets promptly to show attentive customer care.

6. Tailored Retention Offers:
Offer personalized retention offers based on individual customer needs and preferences.

7. Payment Method:
Address any issues related to the electronic check payment process. Encourage more customers to use credit cards by providing incentives such as rewards, cashback, or discounts on their subscriptions. This can help improve customer retention.

These are the findings from my preliminary analysis of the data, we could connect at a later point of time to discuss this in detail to come-up with new strategies or solutions. Do contact me if you need more information in this regard. Thank you.

Regards,
